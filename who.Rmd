Bjarni Jóhann Vilhjálmsson is a statistical geneticist who is motivated to leverage large population-scale data to understand the interplay between genetic and environmental factors when determining the causes of disease. He leads a research group at Aarhus University that is focused on developing methods that integrate health registers and large genetic data to understand psychiatric disorders and other diseases. He is the author of LDpred1/2, one of the most cited methods and software for deriving Polygenic risk Scores.
